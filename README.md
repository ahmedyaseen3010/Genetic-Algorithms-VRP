# VRP
<h2>Optimizing Vehicle Routing Problem with Genetic Algorithms</h2><br>
<ul>
    <li>The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem that involves finding the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods or services to a set of customers.<br></li>
   <li>Genetic algorithms are a popular approach used to solve VRP. <br></li>
   <li>One-point crossover and swap mutation are two genetic operators used in this approach.<br></li>
