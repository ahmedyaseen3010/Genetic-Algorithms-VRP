 <h3>Vehicle Routing Problem</h3>
<ul>
    <li> The Vehicle Routing Problem is a complex optimization problem that involves finding the most efficient set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to serve a set of         customers while minimizing distance traveled and satisfying various constraints.<br></li>
   <li>The VRP can be classified into different types based on the number of depots, vehicles, and customers, as well as the type of objective function and constraints         considered.<br></li>

<h3>One-Point Crossover</h3>
<ul>
    <li>One-point crossover is a genetic operator used in VRP that involves selecting a random point along the chromosome and exchanging the genetic material between the two parent chromosomes at that point.<br></li>
   <li>This operator is useful in maintaining the diversity of the population and exploring new regions of the search space.<br></li>
</ul>

<h3>Swap Mutation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Swap mutation is another genetic operator used in VRP that involves randomly selecting two genes in a chromosome and swapping their positions.<br></li>
   <li>This operator is useful in introducing small perturbations in the population and escaping local optima.<br></li>
</ul>
