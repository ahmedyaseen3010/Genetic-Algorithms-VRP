# VRP
Optimizing Vehicle Routing Problem with Genetic Algorithms
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem that involves finding the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods or services to a set of customers.
Genetic algorithms are a popular approach used to solve VRP. 
One-point crossover and swap mutation are two genetic operators used in this approach.
